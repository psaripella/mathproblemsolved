A 33-year-old woman comes to the physician
because of a 2-day history of mild nausea,
increased urinary urgency and frequency, and
constipation. She also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb)
weight loss during the past 2 weeks and a 3-
week history of vaginal bleeding. Pelvic
examination shows a nodular cervix with an
irregular, friable posterior lip, and a rock-hard,
irregular, immobile pelvic mass that extends
across the pelvis. Examination of biopsy
specimens from the cervix and anterior wall of
the vagina show well-differentiated keratinizing
squamous cell carcinoma. Which of the
following best describes the pathogenesis of this
patient's disease?
(A) Inactivation of cellular p53
(B) Insertion of viral promotors adjacent to
cellular growth factor genes
(C) Specialized transduction
(D) Transactivation of cellular growth
factor genes by TAX
(E) Translocation of CMYC to an Ig gene
promoter
