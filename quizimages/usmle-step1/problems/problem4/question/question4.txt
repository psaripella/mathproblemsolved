A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician for
a routine examination. She says that she has felt
well except for occasional episodes of
constipation, abdominal discomfort, and mild
fatigue. She was treated for a renal calculus 10
years ago and was told she had a "lazy
gallbladder." Her pulse is 82/min, and blood
pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. Physical examination
shows no other abnormalities. Laboratory studies
show:
Erythrocyte count 	3 million/mm3
Serum
K+		 	4.5 mEq/L
Cl-		 	107 mEq/L
Ca2+ 		 	12 mg/dL
Phosphorus 		2.2 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 	95 U/L
The most likely cause of this patient's condition
is a small, well-defined nodule in which of the
following locations?
