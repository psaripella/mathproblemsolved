A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician
because of a 3-week history of excessive thirst
and voiding excessive amounts of urine. She
shows no signs of kidney damage, and she is not
taking any medications. Physical examination
shows no abnormalities. She undergoes an 8-
hour water deprivation test. She is also given
5 units of ADH (vasopressin), subcutaneously.
Under both conditions, she continues to produce
large volumes of dilute urine. Her symptoms are
most likely due to a relative lack of which of the
following proteins from the apical membranes of
collecting duct epithelial cells?
