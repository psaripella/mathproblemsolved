A 52-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of fever and left flank pain. She has been
treated for multiple episodes of pyelonephritis during the past 3 years. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.1°F). Physical
examination shows left flank tenderness. Urinalysis shows 12–18 WBC/hpf with occasional lymphocytes and
mononuclear cells with features of macrophages. Cultures of urine grow 80,000 colonies/mL of Proteus mirabilis.
An x-ray of the abdomen shows a 3-cm mass in the lower pole of the left kidney. Gross examination of the mass
after it has been resected shows that it is yellow, 3.2-cm in diameter, and centrally but not marginally necrotic.
Histologic examination of the mass shows a predominance of epithelioid cells with partially clear and granular-tofoamy
cytoplasm. Nuclei are eccentric, normochromic, symmetric, and without significant pleomorphism. Scattered
lymphocytes and plasma cells are intermixed. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
