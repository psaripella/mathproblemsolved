A placebo-controlled clinical trial is conducted
to assess whether a new antihypertensive drug is
more effective than standard therapy. A total of
5000 patients with essential hypertension are
enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two

2500 patients receive placebo. If the alpha is set
at 0.01 instead of 0.05, which of the following is
the most likely result?
