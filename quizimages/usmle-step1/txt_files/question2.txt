A 12-year-old girl with a 1-year history of
systemic lupus erythematosus is brought to the
physician for a routine follow-up examination.
During the past year she has done well with the
exception of occasional mild frontal headaches,
fatigue, and arthralgias; the results of regular
laboratory evaluations have been stable. She has
missed 20 days of school in the past 4 months.
Her parents express concern that sending her to
school might cause her to be exposed to children
with contagious diseases that might exacerbate
their daughter's condition. The girl tells the
physician that she misses seeing her many
friends at school. Passive motion of the elbows,
wrists, and knees produces mild discomfort.
Physical examination shows no other
abnormalities. Which of the following is the
most likely cause of this patient's excessive
school absences?
