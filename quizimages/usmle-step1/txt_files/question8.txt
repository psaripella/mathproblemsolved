A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician
because of low back pain for 1 week. Menopause
occurred 10 years ago. Physical examination
shows localized tenderness over the lumbar spine
after movement. X-rays of the spine show a
compression fracture of L1-2. A DEXA scan
shows decreased bone mineral density. Serum
calcium and phosphorus concentrations and
serum alkaline phosphatase activity are within
the reference ranges. A bisphosphonate drug is
prescribed. The expected beneficial effect of this
drug is most likely due to which of the following
actions?
